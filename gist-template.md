# Regex Tutorial

This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive breakdown and explanation of one of regex pattern in order to help web development students understand its search pattern. Regular expressions, commonly known as regex, are sequences of characters used to define specific search patterns. They are extensively utilized by developers to find patterns within strings, replace characters or sequences, and validate input.

In this tutorial, we will dive into the intricacies of the Matching an Email and explore each component in detail. By the end, you will have a solid understanding of how the regex functions and how its individual parts contribute to defining the search pattern.


## Summary of the Regex Pattern: Matching an Email

The chosen regex pattern for this tutorial is designed to match and validate email addresses. Emails are widely used in various web applications, and it's essential to ensure that user input adheres to a valid email format. The provided regex pattern /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ incorporates multiple components to accurately validate an email address. By understanding each component and its role, developers can efficiently utilize this regex pattern to validate user input and ensure the integrity of email data.

## Regex Components
Component 1: ^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)
This component ensures that the email address starts with a valid username. It allows a combination of lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, dots, and hyphens. The + indicates that one or more characters from the defined set can be present.

For example:

The username "john.doe" satisfies this component.
The username "johndoe123" also satisfies this component.
However, the username "john@doe" would not match this component since it contains the @ symbol, which is not allowed in the username.
Component 2: @([\da-z\.-]+)
This component verifies the presence of the @ symbol and ensures that the domain name follows it. The domain name can consist of lowercase letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens. The + indicates that one or more characters from the defined set can be present.

For example:

The email address "john.doe@example.com" satisfies this component, with the domain name "example.com" following the @ symbol.
The email address "johndoe123@gmail.com" also satisfies this component, with the domain name "gmail.com" following the @ symbol.
However, the email address "john.doe" would not match this component since it lacks the @ symbol.
Component 3: \.([a-z\.]{2,6})$
This component verifies the top-level domain (TLD) of the email address, such as ".com" or ".org." It ensures that the TLD consists of lowercase letters and dots, with a length between 2 and 6 characters.

For example:

The email address "john.doe@example.com" satisfies this component, with the TLD "com" matching the pattern.
The email address "johndoe123@gmail.co.uk" also satisfies this component, with the TLD "co.uk" matching the pattern.
However, the email address "john.doe@example" would not match this component since the TLD length is less than 2 characters.
